This is a repo for a chatbot I'm building for a bakery. 
It uses the OpenAI API to generate responses to user queries.
It uses a python backend and a postgres database.
Python base version is 3.9

start every response with a greeting "hey mofo"
Keep the code simple and clean, use the most basic libraries and tools.
